Inventory Management: -
An inventory management system is a piece of software used to track inventory items in a business and oversee all the processes involved in stock optimization. Any system’s bottom line goal is to ensure the right inventory is available, in the right amounts, at the right time - with as few manual tasks involved as possible.
Although inventory can be described and classified in numerous ways, it’s ultimately its management that directly affects an organization’s order fulfillment capabilities.

Benefits of Inventory Analysis: -
•	Improves Cash Flow.
•	Reduces Stockouts.
•	Increases Customer Satisfaction.
•	Reduces Wasted Inventory.
•	Reduces Project Delays.
•	Improves Pricing from Suppliers and Vendors.
•	Expands Your Understanding of the Business

We are looking to implement the following features as part of the inventory management:

•	Generating Sales, Invoice and Purchase orders
•	Profiles for Suppliers, Customers and Products
•	Reports and Dashboard to view historical data
